# SQLITE-spotify
This project is a simple login system built with Python and SQLite database. The program allows users and artists to log in using their unique IDs and passwords. The code utilizes the SQLite library to connect to the database, fetch user information, and validate user credentials.
At the start of execution the program allows the user to login, sign-up or exit the program. Once a successful sign-up or login has been completed, users are prompted to select one of five options.
A user can either start a session(1) or end a session(4). 
A user can also Search for songs and playlists(2) or search for artists(3). 
Users are prompted to continually select one of these options until they have decided to logout(5). 
In the second and third options the user is prompted another set of options that appear when there is a list of songs. 
Here, the user can listen to a song from the output, learn more about a selected song or add it to one of their playlists. 
The overall flow of the data between components can be visualized using the diagram attached at the end of the report.
